# Capybotra

A Discord bot that I made for my friend. It's an incredibly simple bot, so simple that you can probably get a toddler to read and understand the code.

Do not expect support for this bot. I only made this public because building in private is cringe.

## Running the bot

To get the bot up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/theltwilson/capybotra`
2. Install dependencies: `bun install`
3. Create a `.env` file using the example provided.
4. Run the bot using `bun start`

To manage slash commands, use the following commands:

- `bun run register`: Register slash commands with Discord
- `bun run register:guild`: Register slash commands with Discord for a specific guild
- `bun run unregister`: Unregister slash commands from Discord
- `bun run unregister:guild`: Unregister slash commands from Discord for a specific guild
- `bun run deploy`: Deploy slash commands to Discord

Other commands include:

- `bun run lint`: Lint the code using ESLint
- `bun run lint:fix`: Fix linting errors using ESLint

## Support

If you have any questions or issues **and you know me**, just message me on Discord. I'd be happy to help :3

If you have any questions or issues **and you don't know me**, I don't care :3
